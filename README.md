# California_Dataset_Feature_Engineering_Practice
This repository contains a practice project on feature engineering using the California Housing Prices dataset. The California Housing Prices dataset is a well-known dataset that contains information about the median housing prices and other attributes for each block group in California. The dataset can be used for regression tasks and has been used in many machine learning courses and tutorials.

In this project, we explore the dataset and perform various feature engineering techniques such as feature scaling, feature transformation, and feature selection to prepare the data for machine learning models. We use popular Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.

The project is organized as follows:

Data loading and initial exploration
Data cleaning and feature engineering
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization
Model building and evaluation
Conclusion and future work
The project is intended to provide a practical introduction to feature engineering and data preprocessing for machine learning tasks. The code and documentation can serve as a reference for data scientists and machine learning practitioners who are working with similar datasets.

Feel free to clone the repository, explore the code, and provide feedback.
